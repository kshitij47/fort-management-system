                    <p>Harishchandragad Fort is famous for its height, its toughness and the famous 'Konkan Kada'. Harishchandra Temple is known to be the pride of the fort. Sant Changdev stayed here for some time and completed his manuscript - 'Tatwasaar'. The Nandi and Shivling in the temple are breathtaking. A cave nearby is always full of very cold water. Harishchandragad Fort is situated in Junnar region near Malshej Ghat.

                    </p>
                    </p>The fort is very popular to trekkers and nature lovers as it is one of the best forts to trek. Konkan Kada is a challenge for trekkers as it is at a height of 3,500 feet. Rohidas, Taramati and Harishchandra are the three peaks in Harishchandragad. Taramati peak is the highest one in the fort. Many peaks, fort and other beautiful places such as Malshej Ghat, Jivdhan, Nane Ghat, Ratangad, Kalsubai, etc. can also be seen from here. </p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>The walls are between 6 to 9 feet thick and 18 to 27 feet high with ammunition depots and granaries built along the interiors.</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>Lucky tourists can sometimes see like tigers, cheetah, snakes, swallow and flamingos, etc. Harishchandragad is must to visit to enjoy the beauty of forest, especially for the Konkan Kada. Nearest airport is in Mumbai (154 km), while nearest railway station is Kalyan. Hotels are available at Mumbai and Pune. </p>
                    <p>The 30 meter high Chand Minar (Tower) built much later with 3 circular balconies played a defensive and religious role in the Fortress. </p>
