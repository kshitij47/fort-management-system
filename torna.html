                <p>This fort was conquered by ShivajÄ± Maharaj in his teenage years and laid the toundation ot the Maratha empire. This makes Torna a special
                    fort for Maharashtrians. Torna is a well-structured fort. Even today, it is considered a difficult fort by trekkers. It stands as one of the most
                    important military structures in the history of Maharashtra and the Maratha Empire
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>
<p>The walls and gateways of this fort are in good
    condition. The walls are semicircular in shape. One can visit the temples of the fort that are still functioning, and devotees visit there
    regularly.
    </p>                    </blockquote>
<p>The fort is even popularly known as Prachandagad due to its huge premise. The origin of this fort is not known. However, the legend says it
    was constructed in the 13th century by Siva Panth who was a follower of the Hindu God Shiva. From 1470 to 1486 A.D., Malik Ahmed, a
    Bahmani ruler, took control of this fort. In the later times, Nizam shah ruled it. In 1646, Shivaji Maharaj brought this fort under his control
    from Adilshah, and it came to the Maratha Empire. Later on, he named it Prachandagad. He was the one who built some new structures in
    the fort of Prachandagad.</p>
