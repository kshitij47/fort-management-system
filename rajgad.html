                 <p>Rajgad is situated on the border of Bhor-Velhe Taluka in the Pune district and is a favorite amongst the fort loving tourists. The fort has three “maachi”s spread into three different directions with the citadel sitting right in the center. Rajgad fort overlooks other forts in the vicinity such as Torna, Sinhagad, Purandar, Vajragad, Lingana, Pratapgad and Raigad.</p>
                    <blockquote>
<p>There is a mountain of Murumbdev in the valley of Nira-Lakhwandi river. Deriving its name from the same, Rajgad was named Murumbdev during the earlier Bahamani regime. Murumbdev Chowki was under Nizamshahi for some time and later under the Adil Shahi rule. Torna and Murumbdev were both crucial for the expansion of the state in the Maval region. In 1645, Shivaji Maharaj captured Murumbdev fort and renamed it as Rajgad. He also commenced the construction on new fortifications and buildings here to make it his first political center, but for the purpose of expansion and on account of lesser availability of space, he shifted the capital to Raigad later</p>                    </blockquote>
                <p>Rajgad stands tall with its citadel measuring 1400 meters high in altitude. Aurangzeb’s army attacked the fort on 4th February 1703 and emerged victorious. Aurangzeb assigned Iradat Khan to be the chief in-charge of the fort and renamed it to “Nabishahgad”. While Rajgad marks itself in the history as a difficult to conquer kind of fort owing to the safety of its fortress and glory of its robust construction, Raigad illustrates the expanse of Shivaji Maharaj’s career and efficiency.
                    The path to the Pali door comes from the village of Palkhurd. This route is broad and capacious and has steps to move ahead. The entrance of the Pali Darwaja is high enough for an elephant to enter along with the howdah canopy on its back. A second entrance follows the main entrance which has an impassable and sturdy bastion towers adorned with merlons, that are characterized with small circular windows. As we enter inside, we can see the “devdis” – special guard posts made for the fort guards. This entrance brings us to the “Padmavati Maachi” on the fort.
